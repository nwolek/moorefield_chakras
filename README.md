## Details
In the performance, these visuals were driven by tracking data from a Kinect. You can see a demonstration of this here: https://youtu.be/ESyaScVUhLI

Instead, this version of the sketch is driven by the position of your mouse for easy demonstrations. The chakra will gradually move toward the mouseX and mouseY position. In addition, the spacebar can be used to make the chakra fade in and out.

The different looks for these chakras were acheived by adding parameters to an existing sketch by Shogo. All seven looks that were used in the Oct 2016 performances are found in the setup() block of the Processing code. To view different looks, change the clickTarget variable in the header.
